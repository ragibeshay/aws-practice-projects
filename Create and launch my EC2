# 🚀 Create & Launch My First AWS EC2 Instance

This project documents the process of **creating and launching an Amazon EC2 instance** from scratch using the **AWS Management Console**.  
It’s designed for beginners who want a clear, step‑by‑step guide to get their first cloud server running.

## 📋 Project Overview
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  
In this project, we:
- Created a **key pair** for secure SSH access.
- Configured a **security group** to control inbound traffic.
- Launched a **t2.micro** instance running **Amazon Linux 2023**.
- Connected to the instance via **EC2 Instance Connect** and SSH.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- An active [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- Basic familiarity with the AWS Management Console.
- A stable internet connection.
- (Optional) An SSH client installed on your local machine.

### 2. **Create a Key Pair**
- Go to **EC2 → Key Pairs → Create key pair**.
- Choose **ED25519** (or RSA 2048) and `.pem` format.
- Download and store the key securely.

### 3. **Create a Security Group**
- Go to **EC2 → Security Groups → Create security group**.
- Add an inbound rule for **SSH (port 22)** from **My IP**.
- Save the security group.

### 4. **Launch the EC2 Instance**
- Go to **EC2 → Instances → Launch instances**.
- Name: `MyFirstEC2`.
- AMI: **Amazon Linux 2023** (Free tier eligible).
- Instance type: `t2.micro`.
- Key pair: Select the one you created.
- Network: Default VPC, public subnet, auto‑assign public IP enabled.
- Security group: Select the one you created.
- Storage: Default 8 GB gp3.
- Click **Launch instance**.

### 5. **Connect to the Instance**
- Wait until **Status checks** show `2/2 passed`.
- Select the instance → **Connect**.
- Use **EC2 Instance Connect** (browser terminal) or SSH:
  ```bash
  chmod 400 my-key.pem
  ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP>
